			<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>
			<p>I’m Marlon McPherson. I work in UI/UX. I got here by completing a coding bootcamp and working hard to land in a position where I could achieve my goals. Have you encountered any bad design online recently?</p>
			<h3>Weekly Reflections:</h3>
			<h4><strong>Week 1</strong></h4>
			<p>The week went about as I expected it to go (like the first week in any course). Reviewing the syllabus, settling into routines, and meeting peers took up the first couple days. Since I had previous front-end experience coming into the course, almost all of the front-end centered lectures and activities were review for me. The review didn’t last long, since we jumped into mySQL and data design fairly soon after. This is all unfamiliar territory to me, so my previous experience means nothing. I expected more front-end review in a full stack course, so it was a bit surprising when we made the jump straight into databases. I feel the anxiety that comes with the pressure of learning new material (especially in a bootcamp setting), but I still feel confident in my ability to learn and apply the material. In other words, I haven’t stumbled off the ‘cliff of confusion’ yet, but I’m certainly open to the possibility - in fact, I welcome it. You’ve gotta fall down to learn how to stand up. Of course, I’ll do what I can to mitigate the fall, but I’m definitely expecting it. I first felt my toes poke over the edge when we discussed logarithms and bits/bytes. I don’t have a good understanding of math, so any math-oriented material will present an extra hurdle for me, but if I continue to devote 100% of my attention and effort to this class, I know I’ll pull through. </p>
			<h4><strong>Week 2</strong></h4>
			<p>The second week of class has been a definite step up in terms of difficulty, a trend that I’m sure will continue. I’m still adapting, and there are some really important topics we covered that will apply to everything we do down the road - as long as I can understand those basic concepts, I’ll be able to fill in the cracks with logic and some Google-fu. Object-oriented programming was the focus of this week, and the analogy of ‘blueprint / building’ makes sense, as does encapsulation keeping data secure. Doc blocks are great because they’re right up my alley - keeping them short and sweet is imperative, and I can write well in shorthand to describe my code.</p>
			<p>From a personal development perspective, the week brought some big changes. Until (very) recently, I didn’t have much of an online presence. I had a Linkedin profile (only searchable if you know my full name) with only the barest of customization. I didn’t have a Twitter account either (I do now; still settling on an @ handle though). I don’t have any other social media, since I maintain contact with friends via Discord / phone. I’ve always preferred to keep searchable personal info off the web, for what some might call paranoid reasons (in a world where people are fired for social media posts, I reckon it’s best to stay away). Professionally, though, I needed to bite the bullet and sign up for a few sites to bolster my online presence. I’ve also reconsidered my goal in this course. I thought about what makes me feel passionate about web development, and while I was browsing the internet because I had reached a mental block, I thought of how much I dislike bad site design. Youtube is a recent offender (in my opinion) with the links that pop up at the end of videos, blocking the view for the last ten seconds of the video. The alignment of the suggested video links that pop up in a grid after the video stops is also aligned such that the titles of the first row of videos are off-screen. UI/UX is definitely appealing when I think of glaring front-end issues like those. Of course, this is tempered with realism (“Who’s this newbie coder throwing shade at Youtube?”) - I’m know the embarrassment of being wrong about something I claimed to know. Sometimes “bad design” is “design for a reason of which you’re unaware”. Regardless, I enjoy design and like the idea of making the web more usable for everyone. The picture activity we did was helpful in discovering this possible motivation for advancing my career in coding - it solidified my thoughts about who I was, am, and want to be.</p>
			<h4><strong>Week 3</strong></h4>
			<p>Capstone is finally here. Now that my final project has been assigned, I have a clear vision of the finish line for the first time. I don’t want to get headstrong; I just feel confident in my.group’s ability to finish strong and put together a polished product for capstone. I’m the github repo owner, which is a relief (I like to maintain a good level of control, especially in group projects - nothing against my current group, I’ve just had enough negative experiences to plan ahead. I’m not gonna be ‘that guy’ who does everyone’s work for them. All I want to do is give the project my full attention. I’m looking forward to seeing how the dynamic of our group works going forward. Our project idea is interesting (it came from a conversation between me and Yvette) because its analogs are not very robust - if we really go to town on this, it could be a huge success. I’m a food lover, so I’m really excited to discover what Albuquerque has to offer in terms of food trucks (I haven’t really checked). I know that we still have a lot to learn, but I definitely have a good grasp of what we’ve covered so far, and I’m ready to move forward.</p>
			<h4><strong>Week 4</strong></h4>
			<p>Capstone phase is in full swing from this week onward. Our vision for the Food Truck Finder app is becoming clearer as we progress through the data design stages. Our project is of middling complexity (for a capstone, at least) - we’ve got six entities, so we’ll be writing six classes next week. Our DDL is finished, and Yvette is working on getting our database configured this weekend. We’ve got a great concept to be working with, so hopefully the project turns out well. Of course, I have my concerns, as anyone should when working in a group (especially for something as important as capstone) but I remain confident that we’ll be able to cobble together something servicable for demo day. I’ll contribute as much as I can to the group effort and try to be available to answer questions or help out whenever I can. </p>

		<h3><strong>My Career Initiatives</strong></h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Network with professional developers and peers</li>
			<li>Bolster my online presence (twitter, linkedin, PERSONAL SITE)</li>
			<li>Brainstorm small projects for portfolio</li>
			<li>Continue to learn more about web dev outside of class (i.e. UI/UX specifics)</li>
		</ol>

		<h2><strong>Additional Reflections</strong></h2>
		<h4><strong>Forbidden Island</strong></h4>
		<p>The Forbidden Island team-building exercise was fairly effective at revealing roles within our group. However, I’ve been a bit self-conscious about my desire to lead the capstone team (control over a project is usually extremely important to me, but I’m teaching myself to let go of the reins a bit and let others take on their own responsibilities within the group without needing to be told). While there are significant parallels between real-world group scenarios and the board game that we played, there are key differences as well - chief among them being the sharing of the rulebook (read: documentation). The game is relatively simple, but it’s difficult to remember all the rules after one read-through. Other than that, though, the game went fairly well (we didn’t lose, but we ran out of time). Personal sacrifice for team advancement seems to be the theme of the game, but the “character cards” special abilities aren’t exactly balanced - they’re also distributed randomly. Forbidden Island is a great general team-building exercise, but I felt that it was ineffective in clarifying teammates’ individual roles within the group.</p>
