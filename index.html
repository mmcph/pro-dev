			<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>
			<p>I’m Marlon McPherson. I [work for a company] that [does important work for the betterment of society]. I got here by completing a coding bootcamp and working hard to land in a position where I could achieve my goals. What sort of work is your company focused on?</p>
			<h3>Weekly Reflections:</h3>
				<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<p>The week went about as I expected it to go (like the first week in any course). Reviewing the syllabus, settling into routines, and meeting peers took up the first couple days. Since I had previous front-end experience coming into the course, almost all of the front-end centered lectures and activities were review for me. The review didn’t last long, since we jumped into mySQL and data design fairly soon after. This is all unfamiliar territory to me, so my previous experience means nothing. I expected more front-end review in a full stack course, so it was a bit surprising when we made the jump straight into databases. I feel the anxiety that comes with the pressure of learning new material (especially in a bootcamp setting), but I still feel confident in my ability to learn and apply the material. In other words, I haven’t stumbled off the ‘cliff of confusion’ yet, but I’m certainly open to the possibility - in fact, I welcome it. You’ve gotta fall down to learn how to stand up. Of course, I’ll do what I can to mitigate the fall, but I’m definitely expecting it. I first felt my toes poke over the edge when we discussed logarithms and bits/bytes. I don’t have a good understanding of math, so any math-oriented material will present an extra hurdle for me, but if I continue to devote 100% of my attention and effort to this class, I know I’ll pull through. </p>
